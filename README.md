# IMPORTANT NOTICE
This repository, that I've barely started 2 years ago, is now deprecated since February 2020.

You can find my new dotfiles:

* [on fanfan54/dotfiles-linux for my Linux dotfiles](https://github.com/fanfan54/dotfiles-linux)
* [on fanfan54/dotfiles-windows for my Windows dotfiles](https://github.com/fanfan54/dotfiles-windows)

Here is the last README I used for this repo, for your information:

# dotfiles
All the settings I use for my programs (mainly dev environments). Contains references to files that are on my private OneDrive cloud storage space.

**Coming soon...**

*and it's under the GNU GPL license because I don't want these files sold for commercial uses, because... I want to keep them free ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯*
